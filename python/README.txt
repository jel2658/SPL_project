Using Python 3.9, I developed a program that takes a .txt file as input and creates a .txt file with all of the original sorted alphabetically. It erases instances
of the newline character and whitespaces, excluding them in the result file. It does sort punctuation, putting them in unicode order before the capital letters, and
then the lowercase letters. I ran it using Python itself, and thus it is interpreted the way that Python files are at default.
