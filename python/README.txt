Using Python 3.9, I developed a program that takes a .txt file as input and creates a .txt file with all of the original sorted alphabetically. It erases 
instances of the newline character and whitespaces, excluding them in the result file. It does sort punctuation, putting them in unicode order before the 
capital letters, and then the lowercase letters. I ran it using Python itself, and thus it is interpreted the way that Python files are at default. I
have also included an Inter-Procedural Control Flow Graph, which graphs the program as a whole.
