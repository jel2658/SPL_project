# SPL_project
Project for my Structure of Programming Languages class.

This program, both the Python 3 and the C++ one, is intended to grab a .txt file and sort all of the characters alphabetically. The result is usually just
a count of how often each letter was used in the file, and does NOT sort words alphabetically. The differences between C++ and Python become apparent in
how each was coded, particularly in the exceptionally much more complicated version in C++. While both programs have their own faults, it was much easier
to program in Python than in C++, as Python automatically includes all the necessary functions and data types necessary to create and open files, manipulate
strings and characters, sort data, and print to the console. C++, on the other hand, requires much more care under good programming practices, with the std::
signifier being the most obvious difference. While one could obviously attempt to just include the entire standard library, there is no telling what might
conflict with one's own code.
